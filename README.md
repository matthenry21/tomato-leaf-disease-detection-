# ☘️ Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning

A complete end-to-end deep learning project that detects tomato leaf diseases from images using a CNN model, trained on a reorganized subset of the PlantVillage dataset, and deployed the trained model as a web application using Streamlit.

## 📘 Notebooks Overview

#### **1️⃣ Dataset Preparation**
 
 note book : 01_dataset_preparation.ipynb
 
Detailed dataset explanation and processing logic are fully documented inside this notebook.

#### **2️⃣ Model Training**

Notebook: 02_model_training.ipynb

Key steps:
	
	•	Image loading using ImageDataGenerator
	•	CNN architecture with:
	•	Convolution layers
	•	ReLU activation
	•	MaxPooling
	•	Flatten
	•	Dense layers
	•	Training with:
	•	Categorical Crossentropy
	•	Adam optimizer
	•	Evaluation using:
	•	Accuracy & Loss curves
	•	Confusion Matrix

📌 The trained model is saved as:  model/tomato_model.h5 

**note** : trained model  was not added in repository due to its large size and was added in **releases**👈
please refer in my ***releases*** to understand how to load trained model for testing my deployed streamlite application.

## 🚀 Deployment (Streamlit App)

**File : app.py**

app.py loads the trained model and provides:
    
	•	Image upload interface
	•	Real-time disease prediction
	•	Confidence score
	•	Disease description and management tips

##  deployed streamlit webapp prediction Pipeline
	1.	User uploads an tomato leaf image(.png etc)
	2.	Image is resized to training input size
	3.	Image is normalized
	4.	Model predicts disease class
	5.	Output includes:
	•	Disease name
	•	Confidence score
	•	Disease information
