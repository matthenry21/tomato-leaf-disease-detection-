    "- healthy and disease Leaf images of multiple plant species.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the dataset is oraganised into Separate folders for each plant–disease combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "*means each folder in this dataset is a specific plant disease and it includes all the related diseased leaf images, healthy leaf images of that plant disease only.*   i.e, just like samples related to class label 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "*The PlantVillage dataset is a labeled image dataset where each folder represents a specific disease class(Label) and its related leaf images(samples) only.*\n",
    "\n",
    "example : For plant \"X disease\" folder contains  diseased leaf images  of that plant X disease only.\n",
    "\n",
    "lets say our dataset has two diseases related to tomato plant.\n",
    "1. Tomato___Early_blight(folder) : contains related leaf images of that early blight disease only. not any other leaf images of other diseases.\n",

    "\n",
    "While this structure is suitable for storage, it is not directly usable for machine learning experiments, where data must be clearly separated for training and evaluation.Therefore, before using the dataset, I reorganized it to make  the dataset easier to understand, and the data ready for proper modelling & evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "### ☘️ **Plant Selection** for This Project\n",
    "The original dataset contains many different plants such as apple, corn, grape, potato, and tomato.\n",
    "To keep the project focused and interpretable. I selected only Tomato folders. created a new folder named dataset and placed all these tomato diesease folders,\n",
    "All other plant folders were ignored. \n",
    "This reduces complexity and turns the problem into a single-plant, multi-disease classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**All available Tomato disease class(folders):**\n",

    "- Tomato___Bacterial_spot\n",

    "- Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus\n",
    "- Tomato___healthy\n",

    "\n",
    "note : \n",
    "- Every image inside one folder belongs to exactly one disease class\n",
    "- The folder name itself acts as the label\n",
    "---\n",
    "### **Creating Train, Validation, and Test Splits(folders)**\n",
    "but this dataset cannot be used directly for training. \n",
    "To evaluate a model correctly, images must be separated based on their purpose:\n",
    "- Training set – images used to learn patterns\n",
    "- Validation set – images used to monitor performance during training\n",
    "- Test set – images used for final evaluation\n",

    "-  ├── val/\n",
    "-  └── test/\n",

    "\n",
    "for example : train/tomato early blight folder has all images , likewise for  val/early blight ,  test/early blight. but in reality images in train should not be there in val, simillay images in validation should not be in test. \n",

    "####  📁 Dataset Directory Structure (IMPORTANT)\n",
    "our **script** assumes the following directory structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- plant project/\n",
    "-  └── dataset/\n",
    "-      ├── train/\n",
    "-      ├── val/\n",

    "- Folder name = class label\n",
    "- Images inside the folder = samples of that class\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- dataset/train/Tomato___Early_blight/\n",
    "- dataset/val/Tomato___Early_blight/\n",
    "- dataset/test/Tomato___Early_blight/\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What This Script Does(Conceptual Overview)\n",
    "This script performs a **one-time dataset split** for an image classification project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script processes the dataset one disease class at a time and follows the same procedure for each class:\n",
    "For each class folder:\n",
    "- Randomly selects images\n",
    "- Keeps approximately:\n",
    "  - **70%** in `train`\n",
    "  - **15%** in `val`\n",
    "  - **15%** in `test`\n",
    "- Ensures **no image appears in more than one split**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "##### **Prevention of Data Leakage**\n",
    "The script guarantees that:\n",
    "1. Each image file exists in exactly one split:\n",
    "- If an image is in train, it does not appear in val or test\n",
    "- If an image is in val, it is never used for training\n",
    "- If an image is in test, it is used only for final evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. so that Images used for evaluation were never seen during training. which enables fair model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "##### **Reproducibility**\n",
    "When working with image datasets, it is important that the same images are used every time the model is trained or tested.\n",
    "our script does this, after script is runned once the dataset structure is fixed means it is saved on disk itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "everytime we run training on this dataset or Re-running training does not reshuffle images\n",
    " our model uses same training images everytime we re train . likewise for testing same test images used. there will be no reshuffling of images i.e train images in test, when we re-run multiple times. as our script\n",
    "Physically places images into train/, val/, and test/ folders.\n",
    "Each image exists in only one split.\n",
    "- so that Every training run sees the same training images,\n",
    "- Every evaluation uses the same validation and test images, same results produced.which makes our dataset reproducable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "##### **Why reproducability is important**\n",
    "\n",
    "If images were split again every time we run notebook:\n",
    "different images would go into training and testing results would change each run\n",
    "it would be hard to know if the model actually improved.\n",
    "By keeping the dataset fixed:\n",
    "results are consistent,\n",
    "model comparisons are fair,\n",
    "mistakes caused by reshuffling are avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**note :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- the script was already runned and the split results updated in directory dataset itself. no need to run again. if you run again images in the train,test,val folders shuffeled again.\n",
    "- if you want to modify the splitted dataset by including other plants from orginal kaggel datset you can re-run the script.\n",

    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important Precautions (READ BEFORE RUNNING)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run this script ONLY ONCE**\n",
    "   - Do NOT run it every time you open the notebook\n",
    "   - Re-running will reshuffle images and change results\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make a backup of the dataset folder**\n",
    "   - Recommended before the first run\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Do not rename class folders**\n",
    "   - CNN labels come directly from folder names\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Do not manually move images after splitting**\n",
    "   - This can break the train/val/test separation\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Do not add new plants after splitting, as i chose only tomato plant-so splitting already done for tomato folders.**\n",
    "   - If you add new plants, re run script again to re split dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💾 script already runned for this project \n",
    "This script modifies files directly **on disk**, not in memory.\n",

    "- Cutting vegetables once 🍅\n",
    "- Cooking (training models) many times 🍲\n",
